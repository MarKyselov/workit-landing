### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<article>
          <div class="number">1</div>
          <div>
            <h3>Actionable insights</h3>
  
            <p>
              Optimize your products, improve customer satisfaction and stay ahead of the competition
              with our product data analytics.
            </p>
          </div>
        </article>
```
```css
body{
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```
